This is my roblox game repository.

The game is a multiplayer speedrun collectathon based around collecting
a predefined number of keys to open an exit door. Players can collect
gears in addition to those keys to overclock their jetpack and move
faster around the map.

Features with the qualifier (LAUNCH) are features critical to the launch of
the game and should be prioritized.

Here is a good overview of how the game works.

Round Gameplay
    -Players spawn in in specified spawn zones. The game will choose
    one of the provided spawn zones at random and spawn the entire lobby
    into the map. A cutscene will play showing the highlighted keys and
    gears. Players will run around the map with the goal of collecting A
    certain number of keys and then opening the escape door. Every player
    must collect enough keys if they wish to escape. One player opening the
    door doesn't open it for everyone else. The players can also upgrade
    their jetpack by collecting gears. Their jetpack will add a speed that
    propells players forward constantly. Once the number of players who
    have escaped reaches the max number, the round ends, and those players
    form a new lobby to go into the next round. This continues until the
    final round where only the first out wins.

Online Play
    -Regular(LAUNCH)
        -This is the main mode players will play. I want this mode to be
        dynamic in it's implementation. Ideally, we have enough concurrent
        players to create lobbies of 50 players. I know at launch this is
        unrealistic. For this reason we should create a dynamic queue that
        samples the number of players in the queue. We should have an
        accurate reading of how many players are currently queuing for a
        game. Based on this reading we will determine both the lobby size
        and number of rounds. This data should be easily modifiable. To
        start I want under 40 players actively queuing to map to lobby 
        sizes of 6. I want 41-100 players queuing to map to lobby sizes 
        of 12. I want 101-500 players to map to lobby sizes of 25. and I 
        want anything above 500 players in the queue to map to lobby sizes
        of 50.

        -The overview structure of the game is like this: lobbies of 50 will
        play a round that cuts the qualifiers to 25. Lobbies of 25 will Play
        a round that cuts the qualifiers to 12. Lobbies of 12 will play a round
        that cuts the qualifiers to 6. Lobbies of 6 will play a round that
        determines the winner. Based on the size of the lobby, the game will
        dynamically account and choose which round to begin the players in.
        As you can see, the game funnels down to a winner over numerous rounds.

Here is how I want to structure the game:

-The game must be very well structured. I don't want code randomly stuffed
in a service because it can be and works now. I want almost all features
related to gameplay to be executed in a way that highlights separation of
concerns and modularity.
